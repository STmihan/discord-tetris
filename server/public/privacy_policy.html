<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information that we receive through your use of our Tetris Activity (the “Service”) on Discord. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of your information as described in this policy.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>Personal Information:</strong> We may collect basic Discord profile information such as your username and user ID to facilitate the gameplay experience.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may automatically collect non-identifiable information, such as gameplay statistics, game preferences, and aggregate usage data. This information is used to improve the Service.</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>We use the collected information to operate, maintain, and enhance the Service. Your personal information may be used to provide a personalized gameplay experience, track progress, and ensure compliance with our Terms of Service.</p>

<h2>4. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
<p>We will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to third parties. We may share your information only:</p>
<ul>
  <li>With service providers who assist us in operating the Service and who have agreed to keep your information confidential.</li>
  <li>When required by law, such as in response to a subpoena or court order.</li>
  <li>To protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users or the public.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. However, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we cannot ensure absolute security.</p>

<h2>6. International Transfers</h2>
<p>Your information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws may differ. By using the Service, you consent to any such transfers.</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or other age as required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information, please contact us so that we can remove it.</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will provide notice through the Service or by other means. Your continued use of the Service after such changes have been posted indicates your acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>
